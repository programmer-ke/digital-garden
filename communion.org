* Communion and Thanksgiving

** The Spiritual Principle

John 6:47-63

- Eating the flesh and drinking the blood - interpretted spiritually
  and not physically
- To eat and drink Jesusis to live in union with him

** The Lord's Supper

Luke 22:14-20

- Develops the idea further:
  - The bread is his body, broken for us
  - The wine is his blood, shed for us
  - The cross is the focal point where his body is broken for us and
    his blood shed for us

** The Love fest

1 Corinthians 11:17-29, Acts 2:42,46, Jude 12

- In the early church period, the Lord's supper expanded into a love
  feast, a communal meal commemorating the Lord's supper
- It was customary, not commanded, every first day of the week
- It was abandoned when the Roman Catholic church was established and
  replaced by the Eucharist ritual
- The evolution of communion:
  Passover -> Lord's Supper -> Love feast -> Eucharist (Holy Communion Ritual)

** Why Communion

1 Corinthians 10:16-18

- We reaffirm our commitment to be one with with the Lord on the cross
- We reaffirm our commitment to the body, both near and far
- We reaffirm out commitment to spiritual growth and maturity in a
  Christ-centered manner
