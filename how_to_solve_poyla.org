* Poyla's algorithm                                   :poyla:how_to_solve_it:

1) Understand the problem
2) Devise a plan
3) Implement the plan
4) Reflect/Revise

** Heuristics for devising a plan
 - Draw a figure
 - Be systematic
 - Can it be reformulated as another familiar problem
 - Induction: is it possible to generalize from specific cases
 - Decomposing, recomposing
 - Solve an easier/auxiliary problem
 - Define vague parts of the problem to help reason around them
 - Work backwards from a solution
