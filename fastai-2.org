* Text models deficiencies                                          :llm:nlp:

Models can generate text that is very compelling yet incorrect. This
is a risk where correctness is very important e.g. precedents in
judgement used in court of law.

A layman may be deceived by very compelling generated information that
only an expert would identify as incorrect.

This has implications on spreading disinformation at a large scale
online, for instance.

* ML Automation                                                  :automation:

In situations where a model might make mistakes, a good alternative to
automating a process is to insert a human into the loop to verify the
model predictions.

Automated alerts from predictions can help timely intervention in
time-sensitive situations, but channelling the alerts through a human
ensures reduces the error rate.

* Tabular Data and Deep learning                       :tabular_data:xgboost:

Generally, tabular data work well with model ensembles like
Xgboost. However, deep learning is suited in cases where certain
columns have a high cardinality (large number of options), or include
info amenable to deep learning such as natural language or images.

The downside is that deep learning models typically take longer to
train than the other methods used for tabular data.

* Deep learning in recommendation systems            :recommendation_systems:

While deep learning may be useful in recommendation systems where
information is represented as a sparse matrix (users as rows, products
as columns), and make recommendations by attempting the fill up the matrix,
they are only good at predicting what a user might like, but not what may
be useful to them.

For example, they may recommend variations of a product already
consoomed, but not an entirely new one that may be useful.
