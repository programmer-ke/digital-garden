* L'Hopital's rule                                                :l_hopitals_rule:

The limit after we divide one function by another is the same as the
limit after we divide their derivatives.

** conditions
 - For a limit approaching c, the original functions must be differentiable either side of c
 - The differential of the dividing functions should not be zero
