* Overall pattern
From the Bible Project podcast.

Rescued out of, through the wilderness, into the promised land

Some biblical pattern based on use of words/phrases.

** Creation
- Dry land created from chaos waters (above and below)
- Life springs forth from dry land

** The flood
- Chaos waters (from above and below) cover the land because of evil
- A remnant is carried through a floating wilderness (Noah's ark)
- Chaos waters closed and the flood recedes until dry land appears.
  The remnant go out as new seed in the land to bring forth new creation.

** Exodus from Egypt
*** The passover
- Staying in a house with blood of the sacrificed lamb as a kind of mini-ark
  
*** Crossing the red sea
- Danger as Israelites leaving slavery are being pursued with the Sea is ahead of them
- The wind parts the Sea and they cross through into a new land free from slavery.

** The Gospel
- Rescued from chaos waters (sin) through Jesus' sacrifice
- Currently going through the wilderness (living by faith)
- A new heaven and earth in the future as the promised land

** Baptism
- An image of being rescued through chaos waters
