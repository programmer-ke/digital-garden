* Self esteem vs Christ Esteem                    :self_esteem:christ_esteem:

- Self Esteem :: confidence in one's own worth/abilities
- Christ Esteem :: confidence in the Christ's worth/abilities

Philipians 3:3 - We glory and the Christ and put no confidence in the
flesh
 - What we see know and believe about Jesus is more important than what
   we see, know and believe about ourselves.
 - When we see Him as he is, we see ourselves as He see's us, and see
   others as He sees them.
 - What we know about the Christ is more reliable than what we know
   about ourselves
   
** Not I, but Christ

Gal 2:20 - Self is not dead, but is transformed: dead, buried and
resurrected in Christ

1 Corinthians 15:10 - Excelling through grace

** Realistic self-image

Romans 7:14-25
- Conflict between the inner man and the flesh
- A realistic self-image does not distort reality
  - A positive self-image magnifies positives and downplays negatives
  - A negative self-image magnifies negatives and downplays positives

1 John 1:6,8,10, 1 John 2:4,9, 1 John 4:20
 - Hypocrisy as a distorted self-image

*** The Flesh                                                  :flesh:spirit:

Galatians 5:16-18,1 John 2:16,17

- The non-spiritual part of us, carnal, natural, earthly, sinful
  nature, bodily desires, proud thoughts
- The flesh is self-centered rather than Christ centered
- The spirit is the innermost place where Christ dwells  
- Paul is a 'wretched man' because he's torn in two directions: the
  spirit and the flesh

** Loving self, loving others

Matthew 5:43-48

- A realistic view of God helps us love others
  - Leads to perfection in love

Mark 12:29-31

- Seeing our neighbours as ourselves helps us love our neighbours as
  ourselves

* I Must Decrease, He Must Increase

** Two Universal Principles

John 3:25-31

If it must be so, then we only frustrate ourselves by resisting it,
instead of cooperating with it

- Galatians 2:20: Decrease comes about not by struggle, but by faith
  in his transformative work.

** Knowing yourself  

Romans 7:18-24

Paul recognized:

- In the flesh there is no good
- The inner man struggles against the flesh

No one is good + No one is worthy = Impossible with man

- Genesis 6:5, Genesis 8:21, Psalms 51:5, Ecclesiastes 7:20, Isaiah
  64:6, Mark 10:18, Romans 3:23, Romans 3:10-12, Romans 5:12, 1 John
  1:8, Matthew 19:25,26, Revelations 5:2-4

- But what is impossible with man is possible with God.

** Not I

Luke 18:9-14

- The pharisee was indulging in self-delusion
- The tax collector had a correct view of himself and went home justified

- Recognizing God's goodness to us despite our failures and limitations
  - Genesis 32:10, Genesis 41:15,16, Luke 5:8-10, 1 Timothy 1:15  

** 4 states of awareness

Romans 12:1-3

- Naturally, most think more highly of themselves than they should
- Some think more lowly of themselves than they should - trauma and
  loss of confidence
- To think soberly is to think accurately without distortion

John 16:33,Romans 7:21-25

*** Optimism

- Magnifies positives and minimize negatives
- Says, "Be of good cheer, ignore tribulation"
- Says, "If I keep trying, I'll overcome the flesh" (religion)

*** Idealism

- Magnifies to the highest possible standards and minimize the efforts
  needed to achieve them
- Says, "Be of good cheer, tribulation doesn't matter if you're spiritual enough"
- Says, "I have overcome the flesh" (hypocrisy)

*** Pessimism

- Magnifies the negatives and minimizes the positives
- Says, "Be afraid of tribulation"
- Says, "Why am I so terrible" (disappointment)

*** Realism

- Sees positives and negatives, ideals and difficulties truthfully
  without distortion
- Says, "There will be tribulation, but real peace is found in Jesus,
  not in the world"
- Says, "In my flesh there is no good thing, but the Christ dwells in me"

** No confidence in the flesh

Philipians 3:1-16

- We cannot rejoice in Christ as long as we have confidence in the flesh
  - Religion, hypocrisy, self-righteousness, idealism
  - Paul counts it as loss/dung/skubalon/BS
  - Religious flesh is as bad, if not worse than sinful flesh
    - Sinners embraced Christ when religious people rejected him    
- It is the revelation of futility of self that makes repentance and
  the subsequent revolution possible.

Mark 14:27-38

- Peter and the disciples had a high esteem because they did not know
  themselves.
  - They were willing to die for Jesus, yet could not even stay up and
    pray
- Rightly discerning the flesh is seeing it as Jesus does:
  John 3:5,6; John 6:63; John 8:15; Romans 8:6-8
  - Flesh is weak, profits nothing, gives birth to flesh, judges
    without discernment, cannot please God
  - No confidence in the flesh just as we'd have no confidence
    standing on a broken leg

** Christ esteem: Trusting in Christ's abilities

- Phil 1:3-6; 1 Thessalonians 5:23,24; 2 Corinthians 9:8; Philipians 2:13
  - God does his own work. To man it is impossible but to God all is
    possible.
    - This frees us to rejoice in Christ's ability instead of
      our fleshly way
  - People (us and others) always disappoint, but God never fails.
