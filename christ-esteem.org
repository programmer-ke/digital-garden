* Self esteem vs Christ Esteem

- Self Esteem :: confidence in one's own worth/abilities
- Christ Esteem :: confidence in the Christ's worth/abilities

Philipians 3:3 - We glory and the Christ and put no confidence in the
flesh
 - What we see know and believe about Jesus is more important than what
   we see, know and believe about ourselves.
 - When we see Him as he is, we see ourselves as He see's us, and see
   others as He sees them.
   
** Not I, but Christ

Gal 2:20 - Self is not dead, but is transformed: died, buried and
resurrected in Christ

1 Corinthians 15:10 - Excelling through grace

** Realistic self-image

Romans 7:14-25
- Conflict between the inner man and the flesh
- A realistic self-image does not distort reality
  - A positive self-image magnifies positives and downplays negatives
  - A negative self-image magnifies negatives and downplays positives

1 John 1:6,8,10, 1 John 2:4,9, 1 John 4:20
 - Hypocrisy as a distorted self-image

** Loving self, loving others

Matthew 5:43-48

- A realistic view of God helps us love others
  - Leads to perfection in love

Mark 12:29-31

- Seeing our neighbours as ourselves helps us love our neighbours as
  ourselves

* I Must Decrease, He Must Increase

** Two Universal Principles

John 3:25-31

If it must be so, then we only frustrate ourselves by resisting it,
instead of cooperating with it

- Galatians 2:20: Decrease comes about not by struggle, but by faith
  in his transformative work.

** Knowing yourself  

Romans 7:18-24

Paul recognized:

- In the flesh there is no good
- The inner man struggles against the flesh

No one is good + No one is worthy = Impossible with man

- Genesis 6:5, Genesis 8:21, Psalms 51:5, Ecclesiastes 7:20, Isaiah
  64:6, Mark 10:18, Romans 3:23, Romans 3:10-12, Romans 5:12, 1 John
  1:8, Matthew 19:25,26, Revelations 5:2-4

- But what is impossible with man is possible with God.

** Not I

Luke 18:9-14

- The pharisee was indulging in self-delusion
- The tax collector had a correct view of himself and went home justified

- Recognizing God's goodness to us despite our failures and limitations
  - Genesis 32:10, Genesis 41:15,16, Luke 5:8-10, 1 Timothy 1:15
