* Self esteem vs Christ Esteem                    :self_esteem:christ_esteem:

- Self Esteem :: confidence in one's own worth/abilities
- Christ Esteem :: confidence in the Christ's worth/abilities

Philipians 3:3 - We glory and the Christ and put no confidence in the
flesh
 - What we see know and believe about Jesus is more important than what
   we see, know and believe about ourselves.
 - When we see Him as he is, we see ourselves as He see's us, and see
   others as He sees them.
 - What we know about the Christ is more reliable than what we know
   about ourselves
   
** Not I, but Christ

Gal 2:20 - Self is not dead, but is transformed: dead, buried and
resurrected in Christ

1 Corinthians 15:10 - Excelling through grace

** Realistic self-image

Romans 7:14-25
- Conflict between the inner man and the flesh
- A realistic self-image does not distort reality
  - A positive self-image magnifies positives and downplays negatives
  - A negative self-image magnifies negatives and downplays positives

1 John 1:6,8,10, 1 John 2:4,9, 1 John 4:20
 - Hypocrisy as a distorted self-image

John 15:1-5

- Jesus reveals the truth (reality):
  - Apart from him we can do nothing.
- Weakness is not the problem, but refusing to acknowledge it is.

- 2 Corinthians 12:7-10: Power is perfected in weakness
  - 2 Timothy 4:14: Thorn in the flesh could have been 'Alexander the
    coppersmith'
  - Being content with weakness for Christ's sake

*** The Flesh                                                  :flesh:spirit:

Galatians 5:16-18,1 John 2:16,17

- The non-spiritual part of us, carnal, natural, earthly, sinful
  nature, bodily desires, proud thoughts
- The flesh is self-centered rather than Christ centered
- The spirit is the innermost place where Christ dwells  
- Paul is a 'wretched man' because he's torn in two directions: the
  spirit and the flesh

** Loving self, loving others

Matthew 5:43-48

- A realistic view of God helps us love others
  - Leads to perfection in love

Mark 12:29-31

- Seeing our neighbours as ourselves helps us love our neighbours as
  ourselves

* I Must Decrease, He Must Increase

** Two Universal Principles

John 3:25-31

If it must be so, then we only frustrate ourselves by resisting it,
instead of cooperating with it

- Galatians 2:20: Decrease comes about not by struggle, but by faith
  in his transformative work.

** Knowing yourself  

Romans 7:18-24

Paul recognized:

- In the flesh there is no good
- The inner man struggles against the flesh

No one is good + No one is worthy = Impossible with man

- Genesis 6:5, Genesis 8:21, Psalms 51:5, Ecclesiastes 7:20, Isaiah
  64:6, Mark 10:18, Romans 3:23, Romans 3:10-12, Romans 5:12, 1 John
  1:8, Matthew 19:25,26, Revelations 5:2-4

- But what is impossible with man is possible with God.

** Not I

Luke 18:9-14

- The pharisee was indulging in self-delusion
- The tax collector had a correct view of himself and went home justified

- Recognizing God's goodness to us despite our failures and limitations
  - Genesis 32:10, Genesis 41:15,16, Luke 5:8-10, 1 Timothy 1:15  

** 4 states of awareness

Romans 12:1-3

- Naturally, most think more highly of themselves than they should
- Some think more lowly of themselves than they should - trauma and
  loss of confidence
- To think soberly is to think accurately without distortion

John 16:33,Romans 7:21-25

*** Optimism

- Magnifies positives and minimize negatives
- Says, "Be of good cheer, ignore tribulation"
- Says, "If I keep trying, I'll overcome the flesh" (religion)

*** Idealism

- Magnifies to the highest possible standards and minimize the efforts
  needed to achieve them
- Says, "Be of good cheer, tribulation doesn't matter if you're spiritual enough"
- Says, "I have overcome the flesh" (hypocrisy)

*** Pessimism

- Magnifies the negatives and minimizes the positives
- Says, "Be afraid of tribulation"
- Says, "Why am I so terrible" (disappointment)

*** Realism

- Sees positives and negatives, ideals and difficulties truthfully
  without distortion
- Says, "There will be tribulation, but real peace is found in Jesus,
  not in the world"
- Says, "In my flesh there is no good thing, but the Christ dwells in me"

** No confidence in the flesh

Philipians 3:1-16

- We cannot rejoice in Christ as long as we have confidence in the flesh
  - Religion, hypocrisy, self-righteousness, idealism
  - Paul counts it as loss/dung/skubalon/BS
  - Religious flesh is as bad, if not worse than sinful flesh
    - Sinners embraced Christ when religious people rejected him    
- It is the revelation of futility of self that makes repentance and
  the subsequent revolution possible.

Mark 14:27-38

- Peter and the disciples had a high esteem because they did not know
  themselves.
  - They were willing to die for Jesus, yet could not even stay up and
    pray
- Rightly discerning the flesh is seeing it as Jesus does:
  John 3:5,6; John 6:63; John 8:15; Romans 8:6-8
  - Flesh is weak, profits nothing, gives birth to flesh, judges
    without discernment, cannot please God
  - No confidence in the flesh just as we'd have no confidence
    standing on a broken leg

** Christ esteem: Trusting in Christ's abilities

- Phil 1:3-6; 1 Thessalonians 5:23,24; 2 Corinthians 9:8; Philipians 2:13
  - God does his own work. To man it is impossible but to God all is
    possible.
    - This frees us to rejoice in Christ's ability instead of
      our fleshly way
  - People (us and others) always disappoint, but God never fails.

** Platitudes vs Principles

Romans 7:21-25

- Platitudes :: Notion of how things should be. Paul wants to do the
  right thing but this is not good enough
- Principles :: What we believe and how we behave

*** The Governing Principle

John 15:4,5; Philipians 4:11-13

- I can do nothing apart from Him
- I can do all things through Him.

In short, "Not I but the Christ".

- Not just a platitude, but a principle demonstrated by the Lord
  himself:
  - John 5:19, John 5:30, John 7:16-18, John 8:28, John 12:49,50, John
    14:10
  - As an example for us to follow:
    - John 3:27, Luke 7:41,42, Luke 9:2,3 Luke 22:35, 2 Corinthians
      3:4,5

** Prayer, the failsafe method

Matthew 6:5-13

- Prayer is acknowledging concern, need and dependence on God
- Not praying is the opposite, saying that we do not need God and can
  stand on our own
- Jesus himself demonstrated that prayer is the ultimate expression of
  dependence on God

*** The Lord's Prayer

- Purpose, provision, power, presence:
  - Kingdom -> purpose
  - Daily bread -> provision
  - Forgiveness -> power
  - Deliverance -> presence

- In short, not I but Christ

- Confessions in the Lord's prayer:
  - Luke 22:42: Not my will, but your will be done
  - John 3:27: I have nothing apart from You, everything I have is a
    gift from God
  - 2 Corinthians 12:9: Your power is perfected in my weakness
  - Zechariah 4:6: Not by might, nor by power, but by your Spirit

*** Asking with the wrong motives

James 4:1-10

- When we 'freestyle' our prayers (led by our wants and wishes), we
  tend to ask amiss. Self is strengthened.
- Examples of trying to adjust God to us instead of being adjusted to him:
  - Luke 12:13-15, Luke 10:38-42, Mark 10:35-40

** Kingdom Conundrums

1 Corinthians 2:6-16

Kingdom conundrums - counter intuitive truths that reveal God's wisdom

1) Wisdom through foolishness
   1 Corinthians 3:18,19

2) Strength through weakness
   2 Corinthians 12:9

3) Greatness through being the least
   Luke 14:11

4) Wealth through poverty
   2 Corinthians 6:10

5) Life through death
   Matthew 10:39   

** The Necessary Condition

Matthew 18:1-5, 19:13,14

- The necessary condition to enter the Kingdom of Heaven is to become
  like a child in attitude, mindset and demeanor
- A child has:
  - No wisdom
  - No strength
  - No greatness
  - No wealth
- Which means:    
  - No regrets about the past
  - No fears of the future
  - Innocent
  - Playful
  - Totally dependant
- Luke 10:21
  - The mysteries are revealed to infants
  - Being converted and becoming like a child after already grown up
    is life out of death
  - To be born again is to become a child again
    - Giving up accumulated wisdom, wealth, strength and greatness
      - Mark 10:23
    - The problem with adulthood is that we are too rich
      - accumulated too much and forgotten about the simplicity of childhood
      - A child has nothing yet possesses everything that matters
    - Being born again daily, taking up the cross daily, entering the kingdom daily:
      - when we empty ourselves we'll possess everything that matters

*** The Lord's prayer in Perspective

Matthew 6:9-13

- Realities:
  - We see in part and know in part, He sees all and knows all
  - We have fallen short of heavenly expectations    
  - In this world, we will face tests, temptations, difficulties and
    enemies bigger than us
  - We don't really own anything, and We don't know what we really
    need at any particular time


- We make prayers to our Heavenly Father as children dependent on our
  Father for everything:
  - No wisdom: I do not know but our Father knows (his will not my will)
  - No strength: I cannot but our Father can (forgive us as we forgive others)
  - No greatness: I am not, but our Father is (Deliver us from evil)
  - No wealth: I have not, but our Father does (Give us this day our daily bread)

- Answering the 4 biggest doubts:
  - You can't trust God's will for you
    - Our Father is on our side and his will for me is good
  - You can't trust God will supply all your needs
    - Our Father knows what I need better than I do
  - You can't trust God to love you after all you've done
    - Our Father loves us no matter what
  - You are all alone an powerless
    - Our Father is with me everywhere I go and I will fear no evil

** The Kingdom conundrum of spiritual growth

Matthew 18:1-5

- To spiritually grow, we must become like children again
- Spiritual growth is not more knowledge or increase of years, but
  simply less of me and more of him.

** Childish vs Childlike

Ephesians 4:13-15, 1 Corinthians 3:1-3, 1 Corinthians 13:11, Hebrews 5:12-14

- Being childish is being immature, untaught and unlearned
- Answer to growth: embrace simplicity without being simple-minded
