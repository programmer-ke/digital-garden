* Self esteem vs Christ Esteem

- Self Esteem :: confidence in one's own worth/abilities
- Christ Esteem :: confidence in the Christ's worth/abilities

Philipians 3:3 - We glory and the Christ and put no confidence in the
flesh
 - What we see know and believe about Jesus is more important than what
   we see, know and believe about ourselves.
 - When we see Him as he is, we see ourselves as He see's us, and see
   others as He sees them.
   
** Not I, but Christ

Gal 2:20 - Self is not dead, but is transformed: died, buried and
resurrected in Christ

1 Corinthians 15:10 - Excelling through grace

** Realistic self-image

Romans 7:14-25
- Conflict between the inner man and the flesh
- A realistic self-image does not distort reality
  - A positive self-image magnifies positives and downplays negatives
  - A negative self-image magnifies negatives and downplays positives

1 John 1:6,8,10, 1 John 2:4,9, 1 John 4:20
 - Hypocrisy as a distorted self-image

** Loving self, loving others

Matthew 5:43-48

- A realistic view of God helps us love others
  - Leads to perfection in love

Mark 12:29-31

- Seeing our neighbours as ourselves helps us love our neighbours as
  ourselves
