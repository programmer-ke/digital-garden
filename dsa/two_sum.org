** Approach                                                         :insight:

The array is already sorted. Start with two pointers at the extremes
of the array. If sum is greater than target, decrement higher pointer
position, if less than target, increment lower pointer position.

** Solution

#+begin_src python
class Solution:
    def twoSum(self, numbers: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
        left, right = 0, len(numbers) - 1
        while numbers[left] + numbers[right] != target:
            if numbers[left] + numbers[right] > target:
                right -= 1
            else:
                left += 1
        return [left + 1, right + 1]
#+end_src

** Analysis

*** Space complexity
space complexity: O(1) - No extra space utilized

*** Time complexity
0(n)
