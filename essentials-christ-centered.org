** Why it matters
Ref: Matthew 16:5-12

*** The leaven                             :relationship:religion:corruption:
The enemy from within, i.e. corrupting influence
Religion about Jesus becomes more important than relationship with him
- Galatians 5:7-9
- 1 Corinthians 5:6-8
- Luke 12:1
- Mark 8:15

Corrupting influence of religion and politics
- Mark 8:15

**** Possible prediction about institutional churches :revelation:catholic:protestant:orthodox:

Matthew 13:33

- Woman (Referred to as harlot in Revelations) divides to 3 parts
  - orthodox
  - catholic
  - protestant
    
** Essential vs non-essential
2 Timothy 4:1-5

- Lack of discernment on what is essential vs what is non-essential
  - Essentials are by definition few

*** Denominationalism

- Unity should be based on simplicity of Christ, the rest is optional
- 2 Timothy 1:12 :: It is not about what, but about who we believe in

- Christians struggle with:
  - Deity of Christ
  - Authority of scripture
  - Centrality of the cross

* Essential: God the Father

** Atheism, Deism, Theism

- Atheism :: there is no God
- Deism :: Non personal, distant God (e.g. mother nature, higher
  power, new age beliefs)
- Theism :: There is a God in personal relationship with us

*** Acts 17:22-33

- They were religious but without relationship
- Worshipping God in ignorance (religion)
- God is living and active and desires a relationship

*** 1 Cor 8:1-6

- Corinthians have many gods and idols, but to the new Christians,
  there's only one God and Father

** The Fatherhood of God

*** Ephesians 4:4-6

- Christians are theists
- God is a Father, who wants relationship
- Jesus revealed God as Father
  - John 6:45,46
  - John 8:26,27

*** Roles of a Father
- creator, giver, provider, sustainer

** 4 External Attributes of God

Rev 19:1-6: God is great and God is good

- Omnipotent :: all powerful
- Omniscience :: all knowing
- Omnipresence :: everywhere at once
- Omnibenevolent :: all loving or full of love or personification of love
  - displayed by attributes like merciful, long-suffering, gracious, kind etc

* Essential: God the Son                                       :Jesus:Christ:

The need: Bridging a heavenly father (spiritual) and earthy children
(fleshly)

The answer: Jesus as fully man and fully God. He became as we are, so
that we could become as he is.

** The Pre-existence of the Christ

*** Col 1:12 - 18

- He existed with God before creation
- He was Son of God before becoming Son of Man
- As Son of God, he is equally worth of worship

*** John 1:1-5

- The Word was the pre-existent Christ
- He was with God and was God
- All things were made through him

*** John 8:56 - 58

- Jesus speaks of his pre-existence

*** Hebrew 1:8-9

- Referred to as God, by God

*** John 1:10-18

- The world did not know him, though it was made by him
- John the baptist says he (Jesus) existed before him.

*** John 17:4-5
- He had glory with the Father before the world existed

** The Christ became flesh

*** John 1:10-18, John 17:4-5
- He revealed the Father
- Came to earth for a specific purpose
- He restored the Father-children relationship between God and Man
  - He took care of sin, which broke this relationship
    - God always loves us, but sin makes us run and hide like Adam out
      of guilt, shame and fear
    - We were created to love God and be loved by him
    - By taking care of sin, he opened the way for the process of
      perfection in love through relationship

    - Becoming flesh was the first step of the redemption process.

*** The only 'begotten' son
Psalm 2:7, John 3:16, 1 John 4:9

- begotten / monogenes (Greek) / 'one of a kind'
- Unlike us, he came forth from God (by a virgin through the Spirit)
- He came from the very essence of God

** The Pre-eminence of the Christ

*** Philipians 2:5-11
- Explains John 1
- Every knee shall bow...
  - Not by force, but by adoration/revelation
- Christ as Lord of All
- Jesus overcame evil, not as Son of God, but as Son of Man
  - He emptied himself to live like man
  - He was exalted because he submitted himself even upto death
  - A rebuke to the powers of darkness
    - The way to pre-eminent place is not through omnipotence, but
      through giving it up (and this insight is not of earthly origin)

*** Other references
- Ephesians 1:20-23
- Colossians 1:17,18
  - First born of creation, and first born from among the dead
- Hebrews 2:8,9
  - All things are under him, but we do not see it yet
- 1 Corinthians 15:27-28
- Rev 1:8
  - all-ruling

Pre-eminence:
- Before all (before creation)
- In all (present times)
- Over all (full revelation in the coming age)


Up next: How can we know Jesus as a living person, and not just a
historical figure?

* Essential: God the Holy Spirit

Question: How can we know Jesus as he is, and not a historical figure?

Answer:
- One who can continually lead us into all truth, continually
  revealing the Father and Son
- One who can complete the good work God began, perfection in love
- Constantly shows us the power, presence, wisdom & goodness of God

** The Promise of the Spirit
- Gen 1:2, Rev 22:17
  - The Spirit exists at the beginning and the end of the age
- John 14:16,17,26
  - Comforter in them and with them
- John 15:26
  - Father, Son and Spirit in same verse
- John 16:5-15
  - You will know Him (a person, not a thing)
  - He will testify of the Son and glorify him
  - He will convict the world

** The Person of the Spirit

- John 7:37-39
  - The Spirit would not just be upon them, but in them
  - The Spirit was not yet given because Jesus had not yet been glorified
    - The word was still bound by flesh
      - Jesus and the Father are one
	- The Holy Spirit is the spirit of Jesus and the Father in receivable form
	  - Acts 16:6,7, Romans 8:9, Galatians 4:6, Philipians 1:19, 1 Peter 1:11
    - We could not receive the Spirit of Jesus in the Spirit as long as he was in the flesh

** The Godhead
- Colossians 2:4-10
  - In Christ is the fullness of the Godhead
    - Godhead (thoetes) is not the same as God (theos)
  - 100% God and 100% man
  - The Son is where the fullness of the Father and of the Spirit are
    joined into a Godhead
  - Analogy:
    - Fire has heat, light and flame
    - The Godhead has Father, Son and Spirit
  - Roles:
    - Father :: Heavenly and Spiritual, loves mankind, fullness of God
    - Son :: Reveals the Father, restores mankind, fullness of the Godhead in the body
    - Spirit :: Spirit of God, spirit of Jesus, fullness of God inwardly
  - Matthew 28:19
    - Baptising in the name of the Godhead
  - 2 Corinthians 13:14
    - Fellowship with the Godhead
  - 1 John 5:6-10
    - We cannot know the Son without the Spirit, the Spirit reveals the Son
    - We cannot know the Father without the Son, the Son reveals the Father
* Essential: Inspiration of Scripture

** Why Scripture?
- Challenge :: How do we know that any of this is true?
- Answer :: We need a record and testimony of God's dealings with
  mankind
  - An objective standard against which all subjective thoughts,
    opinions, beliefs can be tested against
- Luke 24:36-49
  - Jesus himself (the word) esteems the scriptures and teaches from it
  - The scriptures testify of Christ
  - The scriptures must be fulfilled
  - Teaching alone is not enough to overcome doubts and misunderstanding
    - He opened their minds
- Luke 24:25-27
  - Their foolishness was slowness to believe the scriptures
  - Jesus used the scriptures to overcome their doubt

** The Author of Scripture
- 2 Timothy 3:14-17
  - All scripture is inspired by God
  - Profitable in teaching, for reproof, correction and training
    - For the perfection of God's people
  - Spirit does not eliminate scripture, but inspires it and provides
    discernment into it.
- 2 Peter 1:16-21
  - They heard God in the mountain, which was their subjective experience
  - Peter encourages testing their subjective testimony with the scripture
    - Objective standard by which we judge all subjective experiences
  - Who is the author?
    - Men, moved by the Spirit, spoke and wrote what God said
- Isaiah 30:8, Jeremiah 36
  - Men moved by the Spirit, wrote the scriptures
  - Scriptures preserve the prophetic voice, even when the system is
    against it
  - The word is a witness
  - Daniel 9:2
    - Jeremiah's words survived into the time of Daniel

** The Limitations of Scripture
- John 5:37-47
  - Scriptures point to the Christ, but do not replace him
    - The error of religion, legalism
  - Both the scriptures and the Spirit point to the Christ
    - Scripture without the Spirit leads to death, but spirit without
      scripture leads to deception

- Rightly dividing the scripture:
  - Translation :: what does it say

  - Interpretation :: What does it mean

  - Application :: How does it apply

- Summary:
  - Both the scriptures and the Spirit are Christ-centered
  - The scriptures and inspired by the Spirit, and are used by the
    Spirit to lead us to all truth
* Essential: The Fall of Mankind
Challenge:
 - What is God saving us from?
 - If everything God made is good, why is there death, suffering and destruction?

Response:
 - The scripture provides the narrative of man's need and God's provision.

** The Fall of Mankind

- Gen 3:1-13
  - Adam and Eve broke the relationship
    - Not God, nor the Satan
  - Temptation was 'to be like God' and decide 'good and evil'
    - Follow an independent path from reliance on God
    - Being like God without submitting to God
      - The false promise of the Satan, religion, New Age beliefs
  - The tree was good for food, delight to the eyes, desirable to make one wise
    - 1 John 2:16
      - Lust of the flesh, lust of the eyes, pride of life
  - God would have removed to freedom to chose, but love must be chosen, not forced
  - Adam was silent, but silence is consent
    - Even though he blamed the woman

** The Problem of Evil

- Gen 6:5-8,11
  - Evil is a larger concept than sin
    - Sin is to fall short of a mark: offense, trespass, incure a debt
    - Evil is the fallen state of mankind, the world and the spiritual
      realm in opposition to God
      - The world now being full of calamities
      - Creates a sin-rich environment
    - There is a purpose beyond personal salvation, bringing light in
      darkness of evil
    - Sin separates us from God, but evil grieves God's heart
      - sin is fruit, evil is root
	- The law of Moses was bandaid to deal with the fruit (sin)
	- The Christ dealt with the root (evil)
    - Judgement of evil is compassionate
      - God would rather destroy man than allow him to keep suffering
    - Deliverance from evil is also compassionate, but more difficult
      and time consuming
      - Love is freely chosen, not forced
- Consequences of evil
  - Gen 3:8-10: Hiding in fear of God
  - Gen 3:12: Guilt and blaming others
  - Gen 3:15: Spiritual warfare rather than victory
  - Gen 3:16: Hostility between sexes
    - An observation of what was to come as a result of evil (enforced partriarchy)
    - Bringing up children involves a lot of struggle and pain in a sin-rich environment
  - Gen 3:17: The ground (Adamah) is cursed
  - Gen 3:16-19: Pain, sorrow and toil
  - Gen 3:24: Expulsion from the Garden
- The greatest consequence
  - Sin and death came upon mankind and all of creation
    - Romans 5:12, 19, 1 Corinthians 15:22
      - Is it fair that the sin of one man caused all mankind to suffer?
	- The inverse is also true, the righteousness of one man will save all mankind
	- Each of us bears responsibility for our own rebellion
	  - Romans 3:23
	  - Isaiah 53:6
	  - Romans 2:1
	  - 1 John 1:8

** The Problem of Sin, Self, Satan
- John 8:42-47
  - Evil manifested in 3 ways:
    - sin :: behaviour
    - self :: motivator
    - satan :: instigator
  - Your father the devil (Satan), you want (self) the desires of your
    father, they later picked up stones to beat him (sin)
- James 1:13-15
  - Satan tempts -> Self enticed -> Sin -> death

*** God's solution
- Restores the relationship so that we know him as he is, instead of
  running and hiding in fear
- Saves us from the penalty and power of sin
  - Moses' law only saved from penalty
  - The Christ saves from the power of sin
- Saves us from self: our lusts and desires
- Saves us from the Satan by breaking his power of deception
- Eliminates the curse on creation
  - death, sorrow, darkness
- The work began with the Christ but is finished with us
  - Mankind opened the door to evil, and it is mankind who will close it
    - Mankind does not have the power to do so on their own, but only in the Christ
    - God will not do it without us, and we cannot do it on our own

* Essential: The Salvation of Mankind

** The Defeat of the Satan
- Heb 2:14-18
  - The Satan, though not eliminated, was made powerless
  - The first goal is to deliver from the devil, death, sin
  - The second goal is to reconcile mankind to God
    - The high priest mediates between man and God
  - There is a spiritual enemy out to kill, steal and destroy
    - The destroyer has tried to destroy
      - directly
      - through corruption to induce God's wrath
      - Getting men to destroy each other
    - Has been going on long before we arrived
      - Part of mankind being created may have been to fix this
- John 12:31-33
  - The ruler of this world cast out
- John 14:29-31
  - Has no power over the Christ
- John 16:8-11
  - The ruler of this world has been judged
- Ephesians 2:1-3
  - The spiritual reality of evil

** Deliverance from Sin

- Acts 26:12-20
  - Deliverance is not an intellectual exercise but a spiritual
    transformation
    - Their eyes had to be opened
    - God has already forgiven, but we cannot receive forgiveness until
      turned from darkness to light, from the dominion of Satan to God

- Deliverance from sin involves
  - sin's penalty
    - The Christ saved us from the penalty (past)
    - reconciliation
  - sin's power
    - The Spirit saves us from sin's power (present)
    - transformation
  - sin's presence
    - The father will save us from sin's presence (future)
    - In the new age, all things made new and sin eliminated (restitution)

** Deliverance from Self

- Romans 7:21 - 8:4
  - Self is motivation for sin, it is self that is tempted
  - Self is self-interest
    - Putting your wants, needs and desires above God and others
    - Default condition of man
    - The oppposite of love
      - Love is sacrificial giving
    - All sin is based on love of self
  - The problem is not just what I do, but who I am
- James 1:13-15
  - Everyone is carried away by their own lust
  - self -> sin -> death
- How does the Christ deliver us
  - not death to self (impossible), but transformation of self
    - perfection in love
  - taking up the cross, walking in the Spirit
    - demonstrates breaking of the self-centered tendency

** Summary
- God has placed the entire work of salvation, healing, reconciliation
  and redemption into a single defining moment with a physical and
  spiritual symbol; Christ crucified on the cross
  - He defeated the ruler of the world
  - He took away the sins of the world
  - He demonstrated perfection in love; denying his will and
    submitting to the Father's will
    
* Essential: The Cross                                      :cross:the_cross:

** The Two-fold work of the Cross

- 1 Peter 2:20-25
  - Most are familiar with 'Christ suffering for us', but less
    familiar with 'we should follow in His steps'
  - In the Cross all our sinfulness was attributed to him, and his
    righteousness attributed to us
    - 2 Cor 5: 21
  - Galatians 2:20
    - Crucified with Christ, no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me
  - God does not call us to die on the cross (for our sins), the
    Christ already accomplished that. The first work
  - Yet a disciple takes up the cross and follows the Christ. The second work.
    - A spiritual principle applicable to all Christians
      - Matthew 10:38,39
      - Matthew 16:24,25
      - Mark 8:34,35
      - Mark 10:21-27
	- Shows what the rich young ruler lacked
	- With man it is impossible, but with God all is possible
      - Luke 9:23,24
      - Luke 14:25-33

  - Question: based on the above, what is the spiritual principle of the cross?
    a) death to self?
    b) self-denial
    c) suffering for God's will?
    - Answer: All of the above, but none of the above

** The Deeper Work of the Cross

- The first mention of the word 'love' in the scripture is Genesis
  22:2 in connection with the sacrifice of Isaac
  - Foreshadowing the sacrifice of Jesus

- Ephesians 2:4-7
  - The cross demonstrates death to self, denial of self and suffering
    for God's will, but this overlooks, WHY it is needed, WHAT it
    leads to and HOW it is accomplished
  - The deeper work of the cross is 'transformation of self' through
    'perfection in love'
    - It is where we become one with the Lord of Love
    - It is done to us by God's power and grace, not by our own ability
      - Galatians 2:20
      - Romans 6:3-5
  - Revelation 3:21
    - Rule, reign and overcome with Him
  - 1 Corinthians 6:17
    - one spirit with Him
  - John 15:1-11
    - Vine and branches
- Question: Based on the above, what is the spiritual principle of the cross?
  - Answer: Perfection in love. From the cross, to the throne.
    - 1 John 4:17-19


** Defeating the three enemies
- Revelations 12:10-12
  - The 3 enemies sin, self and the Satan represented by the dragon,
    defeated on the cross
  - We are seated with the Christ on the throne
  - The dragon cast down
    - Revelations 12: 17: The dragon enraged with the woman
      - We put on the full armor to defeat him from a position of
        victory (the throne) through the cross
  - The blood of the lamb took care of sin.
    - Sins of the whole world
  - The word of their testimony took care of the Satan
    - crucified, raised and overcoming with the Christ
  - Loved not their own lives, taking care of self
    - Not I, but the Christ, not the world, but the Kingdom
      

** Summary
The cross is:
 - Love so deep it lays down it's life for others
 - Love so powerful it absorbs all sin and evil

* Essential: The offence of the Cross

** The stumbling block of the cross

1 Corinthians 1:17-31

- If the cross is so wonderful, why do people stumble over it?
  - It looks like foolishness and weakness
  - Perfection in love without religious control
    - Pharisees prided themselves in self-righteousness through
      personal effort and willpower
    - In this world, you will suffer..
      - The process of being perfected, the power of the Christ
        manifest in weakness
  - Christ crucified is wisdom and power disguised in foolishness and weakness
    - The way of love, not fear
  - Boasting in the flesh vs the cross
    - Galatians 5:11
    - Galatians 6:12-15
    - 1 Peter 2:7,8
  Q) Whis is most offended by the real cross of the Christ?
    - Jews
    - Greeks (New Age)
    - Institutional Christianity
  A) All of the above
    - It leaves not room for religious or philosophical manipulation
  - Philipians 3:18
    - Many (even in church) are enemies of the cross

** The Reconciliation of the Cross

Colossians 1:12-23
 - Institutional church does not teach the whole truth
   - Only about getting saved and going to heaven
 - The whole truth is a skandalon (an offense)
 - How are we reconciled to God?
   - Catholicisim
     - join the church
     - obey the pope
     - No salvation outside the church
   - Calvinism
     - God decides (election, pre-destination)
     - Most are lost
   - Arminianism
     - Available to all
     - You must choose salvation
     - Most people don't make the decision
   - How about the scriptures?
     - Begins with reconciliation which has been done for all
     - It is not because of what we do, but what the Christ already
       did
     - The reconciliation happened not when we believed, but when the
       Christ died on the cross
       - Romans 5:10-11
	 - while we were enemies, we were reconciled to God
       - 2 Corinthians 5:18-19
       - John 1:29, 1 John 2:2
	 - taking away the sin of the whole world
       - John 12:31-33
	 - Drawing all mankind to himself
       - 1 Corinthians 15:20-22
	 - through Adam, death came to all, through the Christ, all
           are made alive

** Message of the Cross

2 Corinthians 5:17-21

- Ministry of reconciliation
  - God has already reconciled all to himself, we need to accept the
    reconciliation
  - Jesus did it all, but we also have a role to play
    - taking up the cross
  - He has forgiven, we must receive it, and proclaim the message of
    forgiveness for all
    - Acts 26:18
      - sent to open their eyes
- Role of the cross
  - Catholicism
    - sacramental and decorative
  - Calvinism
    - specific and limited
  - Arminianism
    - universal but conditional

  - The scriptures
    - universal and unconditional

  - Rejecting the cross is not about refusing to join the church, not
    being chosen or failing to chose.
    - It has always been about a failure to take up the cross

** Summary
To embrace the message of the cross is:
 - to take the greatest possible risk
 - endure the greatest possible suffering
 - overcoming the greatest possible evil
 - achieving the greatest possible good
 - demonstrating the greatest possible love

* Essential: Salvation by Grace

** Another Gospel
Galatians 1:6-10
- All religion (including christian religion) is about earning God's
  favour through right behaviour and beliefs
  - Opinions vary about what is right

- The Christ represents grace, the end of religion
  - Our efforts are useless and worthless, it is about what he has
    done, not what we are able to do
  - But the religious spirit is strong
    - 2 Corinthians 11:3
      - turning away from the purity and simplicity of the Christ
    - 2 Timothy 4:3,4
      - turn away from truth to myths

*** Catholicism
  - makes the cross of no effect
  - system of religious works, traditions and rituals
*** Calvinism
  - The cross only saves good people that God predetermined
*** Arminianism
  - God cannot forgive you until you ask for forgiveness.
  - How it differs from the scriptures
    - John 12:47
      - Jesus came not to judge, but to save the world
    - Luke 23:34
      - He forgave those who didn't know what they were doing
    - John 3:17,18
      - He came to save, not judge
    - Romans 11:1,23,32
      - God's will is reconciliation, not separation
    - Mark 7:9,13
      - Using traditions to invalidate God's word
    - 1 Corinthians 1:17
      - Truth and simplicity over philosophy

Grace vs Mercy
 - Grace :: given what you do not deserve
 - Mercy :: not given what you deserve

** Unintended Consequences (of Arminianism)
- Luke 18:9-14
  - Making 'my decision' as a condition to salvation makes man's will
    more powerful than God's will
  - Those who 'decided' are better than those who didn't
  - Condemning those who did not 'decide', rather than mercy and compassion
  - False assurance of being saved based on our decision at some point
    in time.
  - Religiousity motivated by fear, fraud or force instead of faith by love.
  - Giving others more religion rather than grace


- Actually the decision is the other way around, it is God who chose us
  - John 15:16
  - Luke 19:10

** The Benefits of Grace
- Ephesians 2:4-10
  - God set out to save all of mankind
  - 2 Timothy 1:9
    - Not by our works, but by God's grace from the very beginning
  - Inspires gratitude and humility
  - The cross as transformation of self
    - Not just about saving me from hell, but saving me from myself
  - Because of grace, we are motivated by love, not fear, fraud or force
  - We give grace to others because we have experienced it for ourselves
  - Motivates a focus on deliverance and not destruction
    - To seek the lost, rather than condemn them
  - Provides discernment into religion as the antithesis of Grace
  - Accurately represets God's character and will
