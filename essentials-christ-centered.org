** Essential vs non-essential
2 Timothy 4:1-5

- Lack of discernment on what is essential vs what is non-essential
  - Essentials are by definition few

*** Denominationalism

- Unity should be based on simplicity of Christ, the rest is optional
- 2 Timothy 1:12 :: It is not about what, but about who we believe in

- Christians struggle with:
  - Deity of Christ
  - Authority of scripture
  - Centrality of the cross

* Essential: God the Father

** Atheism, Deism, Theism

- Atheism :: there is no God
- Deism :: Non personal, distant God (e.g. mother nature, higher
  power, new age beliefs)
- Theism :: There is a God in personal relationship with us

*** Acts 17:22-33

- They were religious but without relationship
- Worshipping God in ignorance (religion)
- God is living and active and desires a relationship

*** 1 Cor 8:1-6

- Corinthians have many gods and idols, but to the new Christians,
  there's only one God and Father

** The Fatherhood of God

*** Ephesians 4:4-6

- Christians are theists
- God is a Father, who wants relationship
- Jesus revealed God as Father
  - John 6:45,46
  - John 8:26,27

*** Roles of a Father
- creator, giver, provider, sustainer

** 4 External Attributes of God

Rev 19:1-6: God is great and God is good

- Omnipotent :: all powerful
- Omniscience :: all knowing
- Omnipresence :: everywhere at once
- Omnibenevolent :: all loving or full of love or personification of love
  - displayed by attributes like merciful, long-suffering, gracious, kind etc

* Essential: God the Son

** The need
Bridging a heavenly father (spiritual) and earthy children (fleshly)

** The answer
Jesus as fully man and fully God. He became as we are, so that we
could become as he is.

** The Pre-existence of the Christ

*** Col 1:12 - 18

- He existed with God before creation
- He was Son of God before becoming Son of Man
- As Son of God, he is equally worth of worship

*** John 1:1-5

- The Word was the pre-existent Christ
- He was with God and was God
- All things were made through him

*** John 8:56 - 58

- Jesus speaks of his pre-existence

*** Hebrew 1:8-9

- Referred to as God, by God

*** John 1:10-18

- The world did not know him, though it was made by him
- John the baptist says he (Jesus) existed before him.

*** John 17:4-5
- He had glory with the Father before the world existed

** The Christ became flesh

*** John 1:10-18, John 17:4-5
- He revealed the Father
- Came to earth for a specific purpose
- He restored the Father-children relationship between God and Man
  - He took care of sin, which broke this relationship
    - God always loves us, but sin makes us run and hide like Adam out
      of guilt, shame and fear
    - We were created to love God and be loved by him
    - By taking care of sin, he opened the way for the process of
      perfection in love through relationship

    - Becoming flesh was the first step of the redemption process.

*** The only 'begotten' son
Psalm 2:7, John 3:16, 1 John 4:9

- begotten / monogenes (Greek) / 'one of a kind'
- Unlike us, he came forth from God (by a virgin through the Spirit)
- He came from the very essence of God
