** Essential vs non-essential
2 Timothy 4:1-5

- Lack of discernment on what is essential vs what is non-essential
  - Essentials are by definition few

*** Denominationalism

- Unity should be based on simplicity of Christ, the rest is optional
- 2 Timothy 1:12 :: It is not about what, but about who we believe in

- Christians struggle with:
  - Deity of Christ
  - Authority of scripture
  - Centrality of the cross

* Essential: God the Father

** Atheism, Deism, Theism

- Atheism :: there is no God
- Deism :: Non personal, distant God (e.g. mother nature, higher
  power, new age beliefs)
- Theism :: There is a God in personal relationship with us

*** Acts 17:22-33

- They were religious but without relationship
- Worshipping God in ignorance (religion)
- God is living and active and desires a relationship

*** 1 Cor 8:1-6

- Corinthians have many gods and idols, but to the new Christians,
  there's only one God and Father

** The Fatherhood of God

*** Ephesians 4:4-6

- Christians are theists
- God is a Father, who wants relationship
- Jesus revealed God as Father
  - John 6:45,46
  - John 8:26,27

*** Roles of a Father

** 4 External Attributes of God

Rev 19:1-6: God is great and God is good

- Omnipotent :: all powerful
- Omniscience :: all knowing
- Omnipresence :: everywhere at once
- Omnibenevolent :: all loving or full of love or personification of love
  - displayed by attributes like merciful, long-suffering, gracious, kind etc

* Essential: God the Son                                       :Jesus:Christ:

The need: Bridging a heavenly father (spiritual) and earthy children
(fleshly)

The answer: Jesus as fully man and fully God. He became as we are, so
that we could become as he is.

** The Pre-existence of the Christ

*** Col 1:12 - 18

- He existed with God before creation
- He was Son of God before becoming Son of Man
- As Son of God, he is equally worth of worship

*** John 1:1-5

- The Word was the pre-existent Christ
- He was with God and was God
- All things were made through him

*** John 8:56 - 58

- Jesus speaks of his pre-existence

*** Hebrew 1:8-9

- Referred to as God, by God

*** John 1:10-18

- The world did not know him, though it was made by him
- John the baptist says he (Jesus) existed before him.

*** John 17:4-5
- He had glory with the Father before the world existed

** The Christ became flesh

*** John 1:10-18, John 17:4-5
- He revealed the Father
- Came to earth for a specific purpose
- He restored the Father-children relationship between God and Man
  - He took care of sin, which broke this relationship
    - God always loves us, but sin makes us run and hide like Adam out
      of guilt, shame and fear
    - We were created to love God and be loved by him
    - By taking care of sin, he opened the way for the process of
      perfection in love through relationship

    - Becoming flesh was the first step of the redemption process.

*** The only 'begotten' son
Psalm 2:7, John 3:16, 1 John 4:9

- begotten / monogenes (Greek) / 'one of a kind'
- Unlike us, he came forth from God (by a virgin through the Spirit)
- He came from the very essence of God

** The Pre-eminence of the Christ

*** Philipians 2:5-11
- Explains John 1
- Every knee shall bow...
  - Not by force, but by adoration/revelation
- Christ as Lord of All
- Jesus overcame evil, not as Son of God, but as Son of Man
  - He emptied himself to live like man
  - He was exalted because he submitted himself even upto death
  - A rebuke to the powers of darkness
    - The way to pre-eminent place is not through omnipotence, but
      through giving it up (and this insight is not of earthly origin)

*** Other references
- Ephesians 1:20-23
- Colossians 1:17,18
  - First born of creation, and first born from among the dead
- Hebrews 2:8,9
  - All things are under him, but we do not see it yet

- Rev 1:8
  - all-ruling

Pre-eminence:
- Before all (before creation)
- In all (present times)
- Over all (full revelation in the coming age)


Up next: How can we know Jesus as a living person, and not just a
historical figure?

* Essential: God the Holy Spirit

Question: How can we know Jesus as he is, and not a historical figure?

Answer:
- One who can continually lead us into all truth, continually
  revealing the Father and Son
- One who can complete the good work God began, perfection in love
- Constantly shows us the power, presence, wisdom & goodness of God

** The Promise of the Spirit
- Gen 1:2, Rev 22:17
  - The Spirit exists at the beginning and the end of the age
- John 14:16,17,26
  - Comforter in them and with them
- John 15:26
  - Father, Son and Spirit in same verse
- John 16:5-15
  - You will know Him (a person, not a thing)
  - He will testify of the Son and glorify him
  - He will convict the world

** The Person of the Spirit

- John 7:37-39
  - The Spirit would not just be upon them, but in them
  - The Spirit was not yet given because Jesus had not yet been glorified
    - The word was still bound by flesh
      - Jesus and the Father are one
	- The Holy Spirit is the spirit of Jesus and the Father in receivable form
	  - Acts 16:6,7, Romans 8:9, Galatians 4:6, Philipians 1:19, 1 Peter 1:11
    - We could not receive the Spirit of Jesus in the Spirit as long as he was in the flesh

** The Godhead
- Colossians 2:4-10
  - In Christ is the fullness of the Godhead
    - Godhead (thoetes) is not the same as God (theos)
  - 100% God and 100% man
  - The Son is where the fullness of the Father and of the Spirit are
    joined into a Godhead
  - Analogy:
    - Fire has heat, light and flame
    - The Godhead has Father, Son and Spirit
  - Roles:
    - Father :: Heavenly and Spiritual, loves mankind, fullness of God
    - Son :: Reveals the Father, restores mankind, fullness of the Godhead in the body
    - Spirit :: Spirit of God, spirit of Jesus, fullness of God inwardly
  - Matthew 28:19
    - Baptising in the name of the Godhead
  - 2 Corinthians 13:14
    - Fellowship with the Godhead
  - 1 John 5:6-10

    - We cannot know the Father without the Son, the Son reveals the Father
* Essential: Inspiration of Scripture

** Why Scripture?
- Challenge :: How do we know that any of this is true?
- Answer :: We need a record and testimony of God's dealings with
  mankind
  - An objective standard against which all subjective thoughts,
    opinions, beliefs can be tested against
- Luke 24:36-49
  - Jesus himself (the word) esteems the scriptures and teaches from it
  - The scriptures testify of Christ
  - The scriptures must be fulfilled
  - Teaching alone is not enough to overcome doubts and misunderstanding
    - He opened their minds
- Luke 24:25-27
  - Their foolishness was slowness to believe the scriptures
  - Jesus used the scriptures to overcome their doubt

** The Author of Scripture
- 2 Timothy 3:14-17
  - All scripture is inspired by God
  - Profitable in teaching, for reproof, correction and training
    - For the perfection of God's people
  - Spirit does not eliminate scripture, but inspires it and provides
    discernment into it.
- 2 Peter 1:16-21
  - They heard God in the mountain, which was their subjective experience
  - Peter encourages testing their subjective testimony with the scripture
    - Objective standard by which we judge all subjective experiences
  - Who is the author?
    - Men, moved by the Spirit, spoke and wrote what God said
- Isaiah 30:8, Jeremiah 36
  - Men moved by the Spirit, wrote the scriptures
  - Scriptures preserve the prophetic voice, even when the system is
    against it
  - The word is a witness
  - Daniel 9:2
    - Jeremiah's words survived into the time of Daniel

** The Limitations of Scripture
- John 5:37-47
  - Scriptures point to the Christ, but do not replace him
    - The error of religion, legalism
  - Both the scriptures and the Spirit point to the Christ
    - Scripture without the Spirit leads to death, but spirit without
      scripture leads to deception

- Rightly dividing the scripture:
  - Translation :: what does it say

  - Interpretation :: What does it mean

  - Application :: How does it apply

- Summary:
  - Both the scriptures and the Spirit are Christ-centered
  - The scriptures and inspired by the Spirit, and are used by the
    Spirit to lead us to all truth
* Essential: The Fall of Mankind
Challenge:
 - What is God saving us from?
 - If everything God made is good, why is there death, suffering and destruction?

Response:
 - The scripture provides the narrative of man's need and God's provision.

** The Fall of Mankind

- Gen 3:1-13
  - Adam and Eve broke the relationship
    - Not God, nor the Satan
  - Temptation was 'to be like God' and decide 'good and evil'
    - Follow an independent path from reliance on God
    - Being like God without submitting to God
      - The false promise of the Satan, religion, New Age beliefs
  - The tree was good for food, delight to the eyes, desirable to make one wise
    - 1 John 2:16
      - Lust of the flesh, lust of the eyes, pride of life
  - God would have removed to freedom to chose, but love must be chosen, not forced
  - Adam was silent, but silence is consent
    - Even though he blamed the woman

** The Problem of Evil

- Gen 6:5-8,11
  - Evil is a larger concept than sin
    - Sin is to fall short of a mark: offense, trespass, incure a debt
    - Evil is the fallen state of mankind, the world and the spiritual
      realm in opposition to God
      - The world now being full of calamities
      - Creates a sin-rich environment
    - There is a purpose beyond personal salvation, bringing light in
      darkness of evil
    - Sin separates us from God, but evil grieves God's heart
      - sin is fruit, evil is root
	- The law of Moses was bandaid to deal with the fruit (sin)
	- The Christ dealt with the root (evil)
    - Judgement of evil is compassionate
      - God would rather destroy man than allow him to keep suffering
    - Deliverance from evil is also compassionate, but more difficult
      and time consuming
      - Love is freely chosen, not forced
- Consequences of evil
  - Gen 3:8-10: Hiding in fear of God
  - Gen 3:12: Guilt and blaming others
  - Gen 3:15: Spiritual warfare rather than victory
  - Gen 3:16: Hostility between sexes
    - An observation of what was to come as a result of evil (enforced partriarchy)
    - Bringing up children involves a lot of struggle and pain in a sin-rich environment
  - Gen 3:17: The ground (Adamah) is cursed
  - Gen 3:16-19: Pain, sorrow and toil
  - Gen 3:24: Expulsion from the Garden
- The greatest consequence
  - Sin and death came upon mankind and all of creation
    - Romans 5:12, 19, 1 Corinthians 15:22
      - Is it fair that the sin of one man caused all mankind to suffer?
	- The inverse is also true, the righteousness of one man will save all mankind
	- Each of us bears responsibility for our own rebellion
	  - Romans 3:23
	  - Isaiah 53:6
	  - Romans 2:1
	  - 1 John 1:8

** The Problem of Sin, Self, Satan
- John 8:42-47
  - Evil manifested in 3 ways:
    - sin :: behaviour
    - self :: motivator
    - satan :: instigator
  - Your father the devil (Satan), you want (self) the desires of your
    father, they later picked up stones to beat him (sin)
- James 1:13-15
  - Satan tempts -> Self enticed -> Sin -> death

*** God's solution
- Restores the relationship so that we know him as he is, instead of
  running and hiding in fear
- Saves us from the penalty and power of sin
  - Moses' law only saved from penalty
  - The Christ saves from the power of sin
- Saves us from self: our lusts and desires
- Saves us from the Satan by breaking his power of deception
- Eliminates the curse on creation
  - death, sorrow, darkness
- The work began with the Christ but is finished with us
  - Mankind opened the door to evil, and it is mankind who will close it
    - Mankind does not have the power to do so on their own, but only in the Christ
    - God will not do it without us, and we cannot do it on our own

* Essential: The Salvation of Mankind

** The Defeat of the Satan
- Heb 2:14-18
  - The Satan, though not eliminated, was made powerless
  - The first goal is to deliver from the devil, death, sin
  - The second goal is to reconcile mankind to God
    - The high priest mediates between man and God
  - There is a spiritual enemy out to kill, steal and destroy
    - The destroyer has tried to destroy
      - directly
      - through corruption to induce God's wrath
      - Getting men to destroy each other
    - Has been going on long before we arrived
      - Part of mankind being created may have been to fix this
- John 12:31-33
  - The ruler of this world cast out
- John 14:29-31
  - Has no power over the Christ
- John 16:8-11
  - The ruler of this world has been judged
- Ephesians 2:1-3
  - The spiritual reality of evil

** Deliverance from Sin

- Acts 26:12-20
  - Deliverance is not an intellectual exercise but a spiritual
    transformation
    - Their eyes had to be opened
    - God has already forgiven, but we cannot receive forgiveness until
      turned from darkness to light, from the dominion of Satan to God

- Deliverance from sin involves
  - sin's penalty
    - The Christ saved us from the penalty (past)
    - reconciliation
  - sin's power
    - The Spirit saves us from sin's power (present)
    - transformation
  - sin's presence
    - The father will save us from sin's presence (future)
    - In the new age, all things made new and sin eliminated (restitution)

** Deliverance from Self

- Romans 7:21 - 8:4
  - Self is motivation for sin, it is self that is tempted
  - Self is self-interest
    - Putting your wants, needs and desires above God and others
    - Default condition of man
    - The oppposite of love
      - Love is sacrificial giving
    - All sin is based on love of self
  - The problem is not just what I do, but who I am
- James 1:13-15
  - Everyone is carried away by their own lust
  - self -> sin -> death
- How does the Christ deliver us
  - not death to self (impossible), but transformation of self
    - perfection in love
  - taking up the cross, walking in the Spirit
    - demonstrates breaking of the self-centered tendency

** Summary
- God has placed the entire work of salvation, healing, reconciliation
  and redemption into a single defining moment with a physical and
  spiritual symbol; Christ crucified on the cross
  - He defeated the ruler of the world
  - He took away the sins of the world
  - He demonstrated perfection in love; denying his will and
    submitting to the Father's will
    
* Essential: The Cross

** The Two-fold work of the Cross

- 1 Peter 2:20-25
  - Most are familiar with 'Christ suffering for us', but less
    familiar with 'we should follow in His steps'
  - In the Cross all our sinfulness was attributed to him, and his
    righteousness attributed to us
    - 2 Cor 5: 21
  - Galatians 2:20
    - Crucified with Christ, no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me
  - God does not call us to die on the cross (for our sins), the
    Christ already accomplished that. The first work
  - Yet a disciple takes up the cross and follows the Christ. The second work.
    - A spiritual principle applicable to all Christians
      - Matthew 10:38,39
      - Matthew 16:24,25
      - Mark 8:34,35
      - Mark 10:21-27
	- Shows what the rich young ruler lacked
	- With man it is impossible, but with God all is possible
      - Luke 9:23,24
      - Luke 14:25-33

  - Question: based on the above, what is the spiritual principle of the cross?
    a) death to self?
    b) self-denial
    c) suffering for God's will?
    - Answer: All of the above, but none of the above

** The Deeper Work of the Cross
