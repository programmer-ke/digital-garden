* Intro                  :big_ball_of_mud:DIP:depencency_inversion_principle:

- Software systems tend towards chaos and complexity, known as the
  "Big Ball of Mud" antipattern.
- Encapsulation and abstraction are key tools for maintaining order
  and simplicity in code.
- Layered architectures can help manage dependencies between code
  components.
- The Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP) is crucial for decoupling
  high-level business logic from low-level technical details.
- DIP states that high-level modules should depend on abstractions,
  not low-level modules.
- A Domain Model pattern can help keep business logic organized and
  maintainable.

* Domain Modeling                                          :domain_model:

- Unit testing the domain model can help describe the domain and
  define its interfaces

- Entities have long-lived identities and can change over time, while
  value objects are defined by their attributes and are usually
  immutable.

- Frozen dataclasses and tuples are great for value objects

- Entities classes can extend =__eq__= and =__hash__= for custom
  equality comparisons

- A domain service can be a function that performs a specific business
  operation, and doesn't have to be a class.

- Exceptions can be used to represent domain concepts, such as being
  out of stock, and should be named using the ubiquitous language of
  the business domain

* Repository Pattern                                             :repository:

- The Repository pattern is an abstraction over persistent storage
  that hides data access details.
- It allows decoupling the domain model from infrastructure concerns,
  making it easier to test and change.
- The pattern involves defining an interface (e.g.,
  AbstractRepository) and implementing it with a concrete class (e.g.,
  SqlAlchemyRepository).
- Using the Repository pattern makes it easy to create fake
  repositories for testing.
- The repository will typically have simple methods like =.add()=,
  =.get()= and which make it easier to decouple from underlying
  infrastructure.
  - ideally we handle one model at a time, delete is usually a
    soft-delete e.g. =batch.cancel()= and update is taken care of by
    the unit of work pattern

* Coupling and abstractions      :fcis:FCIS:functional_core_imperative_shell:

- To improve testability, simplify the interface between business
  logic and I/O by finding the right abstraction.
  - Use the Functional core imperative shell (FCIS) idea to
    separate what the system should do, and how it does it
- Prefer fakes over mocks for test doubles, as they represent working
  implementations. Fakes enable edge-to-edge testing which helps
  make high-level assertions about the code.
  - Mocks encourage a high coupling with infrastructure
- Design for testability means designing for extensibility, allowing
  for novel use cases.

* Service layer

- The service layer defines use-cases and orchestrates the workflows
  e.g. fetching required domain objects, making updates and commiting
  them, raising errors etc.
  - Distict from domain services e.g. a use case may involve calculating
    tax. The service layer will take care of fetching and assembling
    the required data and storing the results, but a domain service
    is responsible for the actual calculations.

- Depends on abstractions e.g. AbstractRepository instead of
  low level details.

- Allows more and faster unit tests to be written in an end-to-end
  fashion for use-cases e.g. using FakeRepository.  Reduces the need
  for a larger no of slower end-to-end tests across infrastructure
  layer.

- Sample package structure:
  
  + domain
    * model.py
  + service_layer
    * services.py
  + adapters
    * orm
    * repositories
  + entrypoints
    * flask_app.py
  + tests
    * unit
      - test_services.py
      - test_domain.py
    * integration
      - test_orm.py
      - test_repositories.py
    * e2e
      - test_flask_app.py
