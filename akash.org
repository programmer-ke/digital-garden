* Akash Supercloud

#+FILETAGS: :akash:DePIN:web3:AWS:AI:cloud:

** Overview notes

1. The purpose of Akash supercloud is to provide decentralized and
   affordable and permissionless compute
2. Users have the freedom to select resources at the prices they
   are willing to pay
3. The significance of Akash achieving IBC communication with Cosmos
   enables it to achieve seamless communication with other chains in
   the Cosmos ecosystem
4. Using Akash's orchestration layer powered by SDL allows intricate
   application deployment setups in the Akash cloud
5. The text-to-image model from Stability AI deployed on Akash is
   called AkashGen

** Akash comparison to traditional cloud providers               :comparison:

1. The main goal of Akash as described is to serve as a decentralized
   marketplace where providers match with tenants efficiently and
   effectively.
2. Differences between the Akash Network and traditional cloud service
   models like AWS:
   - The Akash network is distributed whereas traditional cloud providers
     are limited to specific regions
   - Resources in Akash are provided on demand whereas traditional
     cloud providers may require lengthy contracts in some cases
   - The Akash network is standardized using open source technologies
     whereas traditional cloud vendors provide custom interfaces and
     services that subject users to vendor lock-in
3. The key components of Akash are:
   a) The providers who run kubernetes clusters and sell infrastructure
   b) The tenants who purchase resources to run their containerized
      applications
   c) The Akash network that provides a standardized marketplace that
      connects providers and tenants
4. Challenges of existing decentralized compute setups that Akash
   intends to solve include underutilization of infrastructure,
   non-standardized deployment processes across multiple infra owners
   and lack of an on demand marketplace.
5. Benefits Akash tenants gain include cost effective prices,
   standardized access to resources (no vendor lock-in), open source
   community participation in the network.

** AKT Token                                                          :token:

1. The primary function of the AKT token is to support the development and
   operation of the Akash network the following ways:
   - Governance :: Holders of AKT vote on proposals
   - Security :: The Akash network is secured via PoS
   - Store of Value :: The means via which value is stored and exchanged on the network

2. Staking contributes to the security of the network by allowing
   validators to secure the network through PoS

3. Some key features of AKT 2.0 are:
   - allowing funding of specialized pools
   - providing a wide range of currency options for lease settlement

4. AKT tokens can be bought from centralized exchanges like Coinbase
   and Kraken and decentralized exchanges like Osmosis

** Community                                                      :community:

1. The main purpose of the community is to contribute to development
   of the Akash network and help shape the future of Akash
2. Users can become part of the Insiders program by applying
3. Contributions that build the network are eligible for financial
   rewards
4. The Akash EDU program helps developers master cloud computing on
   Akash
5. Benefits of joining the Akash network community include getting to
   shape Akash through code and culture
