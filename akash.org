* Akash Supercloud

#+FILETAGS: :akash:DePIN:web3:AWS:AI:cloud:

** Overview notes

1. The purpose of Akash supercloud is to provide decentralized and
   affordable and permissionless compute
2. Users have the freedom to select resources at the prices they
   are willing to pay
3. The significance of Akash achieving IBC communication with Cosmos
   enables it to achieve seamless communication with other chains in
   the Cosmos ecosystem
4. Using Akash's orchestration layer powered by SDL allows intricate
   application deployment setups in the Akash cloud
5. The text-to-image model from Stability AI deployed on Akash is
   called AkashGen

** Akash comparison to traditional cloud providers               :comparison:

1. The main goal of Akash as described is to serve as a decentralized
   marketplace where providers match with tenants efficiently and
   effectively.
2. Differences between the Akash Network and traditional cloud service
   models like AWS:
   - The Akash network is distributed whereas traditional cloud providers
     are limited to specific regions
   - Resources in Akash are provided on demand whereas traditional
     cloud providers may require lengthy contracts in some cases
   - The Akash network is standardized using open source technologies
     whereas traditional cloud vendors provide custom interfaces and
     services that subject users to vendor lock-in
3. The key components of Akash are:
   a) The providers who run kubernetes clusters and sell infrastructure
   b) The tenants who purchase resources to run their containerized
      applications
   c) The Akash network that provides a standardized marketplace that
      connects providers and tenants
4. Challenges of existing decentralized compute setups that Akash
   intends to solve include underutilization of infrastructure,
   non-standardized deployment processes across multiple infra owners
   and lack of an on demand marketplace.
5. Benefits Akash tenants gain include cost effective prices,
   standardized access to resources (no vendor lock-in), open source
   community participation in the network.

** AKT Token                                                          :token:

1. The primary function of the AKT token is to support the development and
   operation of the Akash network the following ways:
   - Governance :: Holders of AKT vote on proposals
   - Security :: The Akash network is secured via PoS
   - Store of Value :: The means via which value is stored and exchanged on the network

2. Staking contributes to the security of the network by allowing
   validators to secure the network through PoS

3. Some key features of AKT 2.0 are:
   - allowing funding of specialized pools
   - providing a wide range of currency options for lease settlement

4. AKT tokens can be bought from centralized exchanges like Coinbase
   and Kraken and decentralized exchanges like Osmosis

** Community                                                      :community:

1. The main purpose of the community is to contribute to development
   of the Akash network and help shape the future of Akash
2. Users can become part of the Insiders program by applying
3. Contributions that build the network are eligible for financial
   rewards
4. The Akash EDU program helps developers master cloud computing on
   Akash
5. Benefits of joining the Akash network community include getting to
   shape Akash through code and culture

*** Akash Validators                                   :validators:sig:chain:

1. An Akash Network Validator helps keep the blockchain running
   reliably by validating transactions, securing the network and
   participating in governance.
2. To become a validator, one needs to stake AKT, and have the
   necessary hardware and connectivity to participate in the network
   consensus
3. Validators contribute to the security of the Akash Network by
   committing valid transactions and preventing issues like double-spend
   through consensus
4. Validators who engage in malicious activities or network disruptions
   are penalized.
5. Akash Network Validators are rewarded via AKT for their participation

** Development

*** open source contributions                                   :open_source:

1. The 3 types of community groups in the Akash Network are:

   - Special Interest Groups (SIGs) :: These are vertically specialized
     persistent groups working on foundational aspects of the Akash
     Network
   - Working Groups (WGs) :: These are horizontally aligned groups that
     work on cross cutting concerns that involve multiple SIGs. They are
     typically time-limited and define high level requirements that are
     further refined by SIGs
   - Committees :: These are groups that handle sensitive topic for
     which some level of discretion and confidentiality may be involved,
     although as much openess as possible is encouraged e.g. security,
     code of conduct etc

2. The Steering Committee's role is to evaluate projects and define
   priorities and decide which SIGs and WGs tackle specific tasks.

3. Contributions in form of writing code, docs, testing and more are
   welcome.

*** Product Strategy                                                :product:

1. Akash's long-term goal is to become a viable alternative to centralized
   public clouds.

2. Primary themes guiding Akash's product development in the short term are:
   - Node operators :: RPC, validation nodes
   - Web hosting :: alternatives to services like Vercel
   - AI/ML applications :: Inference and fine-tuning

3. Akash plans to achieve Cloud Parity by providing foundational
   infrastructure like compute and partnering with third parties
   to provide managed services.

4. Akash is specifically targeting the following use-cases:
   - Node deployments
   - AI/ML workloads
   - Web/Application hosting

5. Akash's execution framework borrows from the Kubernetes project:
   - Different community groups working on projects (WGs, SIGs)
   - A prioritized pipeline of projects/ideas to be built in [[https://akash.network/development/current-projects/#list-of-projects][project list]]
   - Documented places to discuss/publish/comment/review/approve specifications
     for each project
   - States a given project can be in
   - Regular documented meetings to discuss progress of projects
