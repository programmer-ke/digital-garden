* objects, values and types
 - Every object has a type and a value as its identity, that are unchangeable.
  In CPython, id() returns the object's address in memory. type() returns the
  object's type, which in turn is an object
 - containers contain references to other objects
 - In CPython, unreachable objects are garbage collected as determined by reference counting
